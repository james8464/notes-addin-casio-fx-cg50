## 2026-06-11 Labelled Stats / Boolean Proof Slice

Completed:
- Added free-text Boolean identity proof parsing, e.g. `prove A+B = B+A`.
- Added labelled PMCC parsing for raw sums: `n=`, `sx=`, `sy=`, `sxy=`, `sx2=`, `sy2=`.
- Added PMCC summary-value route using `Sxy/sqrt(Sxx*Syy)`.
- Rebuilt all calculator files.

Evidence:
- `python3 tests/check_cscalc_engine.py`: passed.
- `python3 tests/check_p3_engine.py`: passed.
- `python3 tests/check_multi_app_suite.py`: passed.
- `python3 tools/check_catalog_scope.py && python3 tools/check_removed_features.py`: passed.
- `./compile`: passed.

Drift check:
- Still serves CASP3/CSCALC arbitrary free-text goal.
- Stayed inside shared engine/test/build files.
- No UI/menu/status changes.

Next:
- Add labelled parsing for more Paper 3 and CS past-paper phrasings.
- Add more Boolean law working, not only truth-table proof.
